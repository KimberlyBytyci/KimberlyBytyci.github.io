                <h2>Machine Learning to Predict the Progression of Alheimer's Disease</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An artificial intelligence model developed and trained in Python with TensorFlow to predict the
                        progression of Alzheimer’s Disease using genetic data from patients.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Made by implementing several linear regression models in addition to testing different architectures and training
                        algorithms such as a genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The final model and research was presented to students in a few undergraduate classes including an Introduction to
                        Programming course and a more advanced Machine Learning and AI course.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Speech Recognition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using MATLAB to recognize words spoken into a
                        microphone by a user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The CNN was trained using spectrograms generated from audio samples, optimizing the model for accurate
                        speech analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The program includes a translation functionality, enabling a user to translate their speech to a language of
                        their choosing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Digital Signal Processing</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An Assembly program developed to process an input signal for the PIC18F4520 microcontroller.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Analog-to-Digital Conversion is executed by applying quantization to the incoming signal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter is implemented to generate a signal that is the moving average of the input.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Porfolio</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A website created and designed using HTML and CSS to be used as a personal portfolio.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Responsive design principles were integratd, ensuring optimal functionality and a seamless user experience
                        across various devices and screen sizes.
